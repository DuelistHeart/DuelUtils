## Description
JimmyTools is a mod created to give a few Quality of Life and Utility enhancements to the LoM2 (Lords of Minecraft 2) Minecraft Server. It was originally made as a mod to help with maintaining character transformations, although it has since gotten various different enhancements to enhance a players experience.

## Features
* **BINGO** - In-game support for playing Bingo at the Snake-Eyes Lounge & Teahouse. The colors of the bingo card can be customized from the config menu, and markers can be customized via resource packs.
* Bag Hotkeys - Support for opening the newly added inventory bags by a hotkey (Set to arrow keys by default).
* Transformations - Support for transforming from a dynamic skin to a constant skin. This is useful for players that have characters that transform (Mermaid, Magical Girl, Vampire, etc.) and want their character to revert to their previous skin after the transformation.
* LevelUp Messages - Support for displaying level up messages in the Minecraft chat.
* Startup Commands - Support for executing certain commands on server join (Currently, only /names is supported).
